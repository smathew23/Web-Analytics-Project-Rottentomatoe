# Web-Analytics-Project-Rottentomatoe

Your task is to build a regression model that can accurately predict the gap between the average audience rating and the average critic rating for a movie.

The task is to train the model on data collected from rottentomatoes. You can collect as much data as you want. The model will be tested on a separate dataset that you will not have access to. This testing set will also be collected from rottentomatoes. The model can utilize any features that you think can explain the rating gap.
